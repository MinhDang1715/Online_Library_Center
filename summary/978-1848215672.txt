This book presents a general overview of the applications anduse of geo positioning and GNSS for assisting the supervision and management of mobile terrestrial professions, information, traffic regulation, multimodal information, pedestrian mobility and indoorgeopositioning, etc. It especially focuses on the field of mobilityand terrestrial transport, the automotive industry and tourism (onfoot, by bicycle or motorcycle, by car, by professional vehicles orby public transport, etc.). This book explores the many possibilities, developmental and organizational factors, as well asnew paradigms, which will contribute to an essential part ofGNSS s civil economy, especially to Galileo in the midtermand to Egnos in the shortterm.Several of GNSS s integration structuring aspects insustainable terrestrial mobilities will be analyzed; for example interms of system architecture, data safety or legal constraints.Numerous diverse points of view will be presented regardingsubjects such as dynamic cartography and new computingarchitectures of: mobility systems, interconnection, servicequality, regulation or supervision functions of individualfreedoms.
